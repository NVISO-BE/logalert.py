# logalert.py

Smart piping of standard output to email for alerting.

```
usage: logalert.py [-h] [-v] [-c CONFIG]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         shows debug output, does not send emails
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        specify a custom configuration file (default:
                        logalert.conf)
```
## Introduction
``logalert.py`` can be used to pipe standard output to email.
A simple caching system is used to avoid sending duplicate
alerts within a certain timeframe.

The tool was developed for cases where you want a simple and 
robust way of being alerted whenever something interesting
happens on a system.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6 *(earlier versions of 3.X might work, but not tested)*
- Configuration details for an outbound mail server

## Installation

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## How to use

There is a simple configuration file to complete with the details
of your mail server and account settings. An example is provided
in ``logalert.conf``.

Once the configuration file has been completed, standard output
can be sent to e-mail by "piping" standard output into it:

``echo "Hello World" | python logalert.py -c logalert.conf``

The message will arrive as an alert in your inbox!

## Configuration

All parameters to configure including documentationare listed
in the example configuration file [``logalert.conf``](logalert.conf).  


## Examples

``logalerty.py`` can be used for a wide variety of cases where you
want to be alerted of activity on a computer. A few examples:

### Continuous monitoring
For continuous monitoring of a system, commands that make 
use of ``logalert.py`` should be added as a cron job to the system.
In the examples below, each command is part of a bash script which is
ran each minute on the system. The caching system of ``logalert.py``
ensures the sending of only new alerts and avoids duplicates.

### Alert on logging of high severity IDS alerts
``cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json | grep -v '"severity":3' | python logalert.py -c logalert.conf``

### Alert on potential overheating of a Raspberry pi (>=83 degrees)
``vcgencmd measure_temp | egrep -o '[0-9]*\.[0-9]*' 
| grep -o '[8-9][3-9]\.[0-9]' 
| xargs -n 1 echo "Raspberry Pi temprature:" 
| xargs -d '\n' -n 1 echo "$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")"
| grep  '[8-9][3-9]\.[0-9]' 
| python logalert.py -c logalert.conf``

<em>(the regexp. should be improved as it now ignores 91 and 92 degrees - when the pi
reaches this temperature however it will practically be on fire).</em>

### Alert on a disk filling beyond 80%
``df -akh / | cut -d "%" -f 1,2 | grep -o '[0-9]\+%' 
|xargs -n 1 echo "Disk used:" | grep -o '[8-9][0-9]%'
| grep -v CRON | python logalert.py -c logalert.conf``

### Detect VPN logons from a suspicious country
``cat /var/log/syslog
| grep "docker-openvpn_server" 
| grep "Connection Initiated with" 
| grep -v CRON 
| cut -d "]" -f 4- | cut -d ":" -f 1 
| xargs -n 1 geoiplookup {} |cut -d ":" -f 2- 
| cut -d "," -f 2-  | xargs -n 1 echo "VPN logon from" 
| python logalert.py -c logalert.conf
``
